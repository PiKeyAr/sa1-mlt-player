# Sonic Adventure (Dreamcast) Sequence Player

This is a simple program to load and play MLT soundbanks from the Dreamcast version of Sonic Adventure. The code is based on a KATANA SDK 9 sequence sample (samples\audio\sequence).

To compile, use CodeWarrior from KATANA SDK version 9.
This tool was made for the single purpose of ripping SA1 MLT soundbanks, and it may not work with MLT files from other games. Soundbank names are hardcoded, and in general the code is quite ugly and provided as-is.
